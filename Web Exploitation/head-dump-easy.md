# [Head-Dump - Easy](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/476?category=1&page=1)

## Challenge Description

Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.
The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Challenge Overview

This challenge **launches an instance of a website**, and lets users explore on their own to find a file containing the flag, supposedly **hidden in an endpoint**.

## Assumptions

- Since I had no idea where to look, I decided to start first by **pressing F12** and checking the Elements and Console of that particular website, which ended being **a waste of time**
- Then, I tried to actually explore the website in hopes to find a **hidden button** or some sort, which I did

## Solving Steps

1. Launch the instance of the website provided
2. Click on the "**#API Documentation**" posted by John Doe 4 hours ago
3. On the "**Diagnosing**" section, click "try it out" then "**Execute**" on the GET request which was named "**/heapdump**"
4. There should be a **Download File** option down in the details part, download the file and it should provide a **heapsnapshot file**
5. To access and view the heapsnapshot file, rename the file extension to **JSON** format and open it in any text editor
6. Find the flag inside the file by using CTRL+F or whatever hotkey was set to search, and find "PicoCTF"
7. The flag is found at line 286047

## Answer

    picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_ad7ea5ae}

## Resources Used

- VS Code - To view the downloaded heapsnapshot file
- [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshot-schema) - Discovered about how to view heapsnapshot files, which is to change their file format into JSON

## Reflection

I am not very good at the Web Exploitation category, because I actually spent quite some time just looking around at the console for no reason, I should instead explore my whole provided environment first to find any clues or keys to solving the challenge next time
