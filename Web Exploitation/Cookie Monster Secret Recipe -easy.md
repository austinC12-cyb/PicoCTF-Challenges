## Challenge Description

Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?
You can access the Cookie Monster _[here](http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:57968/)_ and good luck

## Challenge Overview

This challenge provides users with a website that seems to only have a basic login feature, which includes a username and password text box, and somehow figure out a way to locate the flag

## Assumptions

- I thought the valid login credentials was hidden somewhere in the website provided, and searched the blank white spaces for a few minutes.
- Then i tried to enter random username and passwords, which then gave a hint to _Check My Cookies_
- I tried to check my cookies inside Chrome's settings and did find this particular website indeed had a cookie placed on my computer

## Solving Steps

1. Inspect the website either by right clicking, then `Inspect` or pressing `F12`
2. Go to the `Application` tab from the top and you should see "Cookies" in the Storage Section
3. Select the Cookie drop down section and there should only be one cookie from "http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net"
4. After you clicked on the specific cookie, a **Cookie Value** should be displayed near the bottom of the panel
5. Copy the Cookie Value `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzZFODFGQzFFfQ%3D%3D` and **Decode** it with a **[Base64 Decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/)**
6. The flag will be the decoded value

- And a quick search on how to find cookie values from a website (The AI Overview should give a nice tip)

## Reflection

This is a second attempt at this challenge, which the first was a few months ago and I kept looking for answers in the console. The lesson learnt is **ALWAYS SEARCH FOR WHAT YOU DONT KNOW**. Work Smart
